## Project Manager:
Ella DOSSOU
Cohort : 15 SE ALX program

Start date : 9 October 2023 End date : 16 October 2023

## Description :
This is the first step towards building our first complete web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important, as we'll be using what we've built during this project in all subsequent projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration...

Each task is linked and will help you to :

set up a parent class (called BaseModel) to handle initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
create a simple serialization/deserialization flow: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> File
create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place...) that inherit from BaseModel
create the project's first abstract storage engine: File storage.
create all the unittests to validate all our classes and our storage engine.
What is a command interpreter?
Do you remember Shell? It's exactly the same thing, but limited to a specific use case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects in our project:

Create a new object (e.g. a new user or a new location)
Retrieve an object from a file, database, etc.
Perform operations on objects (count, calculate statistics, etc.)
Update object attributes
Destroy an object

## Environment :
The console was developed in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)


## Execution

 ./console.py

First and foremost, I'd like to say a word of thanks to the Airbnb team for giving young people the opportunity to benefit from this dynamic form of learning.
